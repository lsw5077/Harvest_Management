# Harvest_Management
Model functions and run code for the harvest management book chapter.

Dear Reader,

I developed this model in the Spring-Summer of 2020. As you are probably aware, that was a stressful time and there are many things I plan to improve about this model. If you have any questions or recommendations for improvement, please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Sincerely,

Lyndsie Wszola
