# A note on the code from Evolving Regulations for a Changing World

Dear Reader,

I developed this model in the Spring-Summer of 2020. As you are probably aware, that was a stressful time and there are many things I plan to improve about this model. If any part of this code is useful to you for a class or project (even if it is just to demonstrate what happens when a scientist opperates under severe stress for an extended time period), I am happy to share it with acknowledgement. If you have any questions or recommendations for improvement, please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Sincerely,

Lyndsie Wszola
